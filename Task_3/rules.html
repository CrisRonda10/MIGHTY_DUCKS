                            minimum width and length. These dimensions should be<br>adhered to for all fields used by teams

                                yards.Leagues, districts or associations participating in<br>the state competition program that are
                                unable to provide a field that meets these<br>minimum requirements must advise the State Competition
                                Board which will<br>assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the
                                Board<br>whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams<br>from leagues,
                                districts or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable<br>field may be required to play
